# Personal Framework for AI/ML Leadership

**Date:** December 6, 2025

### 1. Introduction & Reflection on Growth
When I began this course, I assessed my leadership capabilities with a distinct imbalance: I rated myself highly in technical execution—defining logic, optimizing code, and managing data pipelines—but lower in change management and emotional intelligence. My initial assumption was that if a model was mathematically superior, adoption would follow automatically. I often viewed resistance from stakeholders not as a valid psychological response to change, but as a lack of technical understanding.

Throughout this course, my perspective has fundamentally shifted. I have learned that the true challenge of AI leadership is not in the *creation* of intelligence, but in the *integration* of it. Reflecting on the "Agentic AI" shift the industry is witnessing in late 2025, I realize that as tools become more autonomous, the human leader's role must shift from "manager of tasks" to "architect of culture." A specific moment of growth occurred when I recognized that deploying a "black box" model without explanation breeds fear; true leadership requires demystifying the technology to build trust. I now understand that my effectiveness is defined by my ability to bridge the gap between complex algorithms and the human workforce that relies on them.

### 2. Mission Statement
**"To lead the human-centric transformation of supply chain operations by bridging the gap between intuition and algorithm. My purpose is to build transparent, 'Agentic' AI systems that do not merely replace human effort but elevate it—stewarding resources efficiently while empowering teams to move from reactive firefighting to strategic innovation."**

### 3. Core Values
My decisions and actions will be guided by four non-negotiable values that align my professional ambitions with my personal ethics and faith:

* **Stewardship (The "Why"):** I believe leadership is a temporary trust, not a permanent possession. In an AI context, this means I am a steward of both data and people. I will not implement automation simply because it is possible; I will do so only when it serves the higher purpose of reducing waste, improving sustainability, and freeing human workers from drudgery to focus on higher-value work.
* **Radical Transparency (The "How"):** In an era of deep learning and opacity, I commit to "Explainable AI" (XAI). I value the hard truth over the convenient black box. I will ensure that every stakeholder—from the warehouse floor to the executive suite—understands *why* a model made a specific recommendation. If I cannot explain it, I will not deploy it.
* **Empathy in Transition (The "Who"):** I recognize that technological disruption causes anxiety. I will lead with patience, validating the fears of my team rather than dismissing them. I commit to being a "servant leader" who prioritizes the psychological safety of my team, ensuring they feel secure enough to experiment with new tools without fear of obsolescence.
* **Ethical Vigilance (The "Guardrails"):** I will hold myself accountable for the unseen consequences of my models. I commit to proactively auditing for bias in training data and ensuring that our efficiency metrics never compromise the dignity or fairness owed to individuals.

### 4. Key Objectives
I have set the following specific, measurable objectives to achieve over the next 24 months:

* **Technical Authority:** Transition from a generalist manager to a specialized "AI Architect" in Supply Chain.
    * *Metric:* Maintain a 4.0 GPA in my MS in AI Data Analytics (starting Jan 2026) and successfully deploy one "Agentic" workflow at Tredence that operates autonomously for 30+ days.
* **Cultural Safety:** Foster a culture of "iterative failure" within my team.
    * *Metric:* Establish a monthly "Innovation Lab" session where team members present failed experiments or new ideas without judgment, aiming for 20% of department ideas to originate from junior staff.
* **Ethical Governance:** Establish a formal "Model Ethics Review" process for my department.
    * *Metric:* Create and enforce a checklist for data bias and privacy that must be signed off before any new model enters production.

### 5. Action Plans
To achieve these objectives, I will execute the following strategy:

**Short-Term (0–6 Months): The Foundation**
* **Academic:** Begin the MS in AI Data Analytics at Indiana Wesleyan University with a focus on foundational ethics and data architecture.
* **Professional:** Initiate a "data audit" at Tredence to identify manual, repetitive tasks suitable for Agentic AI pilot programs.
* **Leadership:** Conduct one-on-one "change readiness" interviews with my direct reports to understand their specific fears and hopes regarding AI adoption.

**Medium-Term (6–18 Months): The Application**
* **Project Launch (The "Watchdog" Pilot):** I will lead the development of an autonomous "Supply Risk Watchdog" agent within our Databricks environment. This agent will continuously ingest external risk signals (e.g., port strikes, severe weather alerts) and cross-reference them against our live "Open Purchase Orders" table.
    * *Goal:* Instead of relying on manual updates, the agent will autonomously trigger Slack alerts to the specific buyer responsible for impacted parts, reducing our reaction time to supply shocks from days to minutes. This serves as a low-risk, high-visibility proof of concept for Agentic AI.
* **Mentorship:** Identify a mentor within the industry who has successfully navigated the H1B professional landscape to executive leadership, seeking guidance on cross-cultural leadership.
* **Skill Transfer:** Launch an internal workshop series titled "Python for Supply Chain," teaching my non-technical team members the basics of data literacy to future-proof their careers.

**Long-Term (18+ Months): The Expansion**
* **Thought Leadership:** Publish a white paper or internal case study on the "ROI of Ethical AI in Logistics," demonstrating that transparent models yield better long-term results than opaque ones.
* **Expansion:** Scale the "Agentic" framework to other departments, moving from a team leader to an organizational strategist who advises on AI governance across the company.

### 6. Evaluation and Adaptation
A static framework is dangerous in a dynamic field. I will use the following mechanisms to ensure I stay on track:

* **The "Pre-Mortem" Analysis:** Before launching any major AI initiative, I will hold a session to ask, "If this project fails in 6 months, why did it happen?" This will force me to confront potential ethical or cultural pitfalls early.
* **Quarterly "Board Meeting of One":** Every 90 days, I will review my academic progress and project milestones against this document. I will ask myself: *Am I still serving my core values, or have I drifted toward efficiency at the expense of empathy?*
* **Feedback Loops:** I will implement an anonymous feedback channel for my team to rate my support during transitions. I will specifically ask: *Did you feel heard during this change?* and *Do you trust the tools we are building?*
* **Continuous Learning:** I will commit to reading one book per month on the *societal* impacts of technology (not just technical manuals) to keep my perspective grounded in the human experience.
